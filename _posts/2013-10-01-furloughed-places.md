###As of today:###

I, **Andrew Burnes**, am on furlough due to lack of a US Federal budget which resulted in a shutdown of the US Government.  I am a [GIS][gis-wiki] Analyst for the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service.  I may be "out" but I'm **not** down; finally, I can take this time to work full-time on passion projects. This blog will act as a reflection of my learning experiences, work, and interest. Honestly, I want to get shit done.  Together we will laugh and cry, live and learn, and hopefully more than just a few friends will read this once... kinda... never again.
